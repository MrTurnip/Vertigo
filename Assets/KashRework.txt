[Traits]
 - Personality: sarcastic, presumptuous, un-empathetic. 
 - Motivation: He is looking to find the magic responsible for the curse lingering over this land and intends to reverse engineer it for himself.
- Background: Born a slave into a small village in the middle-east, he was eventually bought by the temple to become a scribe. He first learned to read the stars and when it was found that he could read the future in then he was taken up as a student. 
His village was attacked again and his temple was destroyed. A slave once more he was made to take on new gods, a new language, new masters, and be beliefs. The land became consumed in war thereafter and the cycle continued. He learned to do math, to sew grains, to paint, to whip, to slaughter, to divine. rather than believe nothing and beyond believing everything he came to understand that Death was the one true god of this world. Meditating in a field of bodies from a fresh battle he connected with the god and so have the first priest of a secret religion. 
Immortal then, his life's mission was to create an endless cycle of suffering and healing. He could both heal and hurt others. He could be anything anyone wanted. he could last the ages. 
and so he did. But his body collected wounds that refused to heal and so as he withered he decided that a new vessel as necessary and so by that time he had his cyber body constructed with an empty chest cavity to store his undying mummified body. 
Traveling the space became affordable to the public. One day, just before preparing for a trans-galactic leap there was a malfunction and the ship entered into hyper-space but never returned. Kash awoke 200ft off shore and was stuck there every since. 
- Interests: alchemy, sorcery, science, war.
- Ability 1: Sorcery. Kash can perform just about any spell, but in order to invoke he must perform a motion, speak some ancient words, and focus the thought in order to draw out the spell from within himself. The weakness is that he lacks a wide library of spells, and what's more is if any of the steps are interrupted the spell will fail. Each spell requires 5-10 seconds to perform while standing in one place and mainting eye-contact with the target. Especially powerful spells require components that are destroyed upon performance. 
- Ability 2: Soul-syphon. Kash opens his chest cavity and reveals his remains. While revealed any creature within 10ft begins to have its life- force stolen into the remains, temporarily giving Kash the same powers and abilities for up to three days. After 60 seconds of exposure the victim is dead. while exposed like this Kash's corpse can be desecrated and his soul set free. While like this he vulnerable to critical damage.

 - Weakness: He is by no means a leader - he was born and raised a servant and so will choke-up when place in a place of highest authority. What's more while his cybernetic body grants him strength and agility like never before, it does not heal itself and requires special tools to do so. He is not a fighter - in a fight he best left to surprise attacks or acting from the back; in a brawl he'll lose 9/10 times.
