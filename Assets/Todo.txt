Vertigo. A game of confusion while trying to navigate a winding platform.
Gameplay consists of 10 levels, each consisting of a winding platform with an exit-flag at the end. You play as a marble trying to roll across without falling off. During gameplay your camera's view will slowly rotate (clockwise or counter-clockwise) while your controls remain direct. 
As the levels progress the paths become narrowers and narrower, with special traps along the way to push you off. 
 
Level difficulty is rated by how many turns you need to make. Each level includes an extra turn.
After the fifth level traps are featured with the difficulty; these traps punish bad timing in movement. 
The goal of the game is to make it as far as you can without dying; once you run out of lives the game is over.
You get 3 lives.
